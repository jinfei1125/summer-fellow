## SQL-style Database Provider Comparison

| Provider   | Cost | Advantages | Limitations | Note |
| --- | ------ | -------- | -------- | -------|
| Planetscale | - Free Tier: 3 free databases, 10GB storage, 100 million rows read/mo, 10 million rows written/mo (per database) <br/>- $1.25 per 1GB storage, $15/mo per 100 million rows read, $15/mo per 10 million rows written | - Serverless <br/> - Fast (reads 1000 rows/s, writes 200 rows/s) <br/>- Built on MySQL and Vitess (a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL, powering Slack, Square, GitHub, YouTube, enterprise reliability) <br/>- Scale indefinitely <br/>- Branch feature: making non-blocking schema changes possible <br/>- Online GUI and local CLI <br/>- Could be in free tier? | - only mySQL compatible <br/>- focusing on branching/testing schema instead of just storing  | Docs: https://docs.planetscale.com/ <br/> (I feel the schema of our database won't change often?)|
| yugabyteDB |Free tier: (Cluster: One three-node YugabyteDB cluster Storage: 5 GB High availability: Across multiple availability zones Client APIs: YSQL and YCQL Administration: Yugabyte Cloud Console) Customized pricing plan needs email contact (no reply yet)| - Could Native (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, Pivotal, Docker, Kubernetes) - High performance (Single-digit millisecond latency) - auto sharding and rebalancing (planetscale's branching) - global resilience for future replica - internet-scale apps - reduced infrastructure and software licensing costs - Integration w/ Apache Kafka, Spark, KSQL - Open Source - PostgreSQL compatible - Enterprise feature (read replicas, security, distributed backups, change data capture) | - only four deployment (macOS, linux, kubernetes, docker) - need provide email to know the pricing, and free tier is still in beta |[Compare yugabyte with other database](https://docs.yugabyte.com/latest/comparisons/) |
| Supabase | Free tier: - 500M database space - unlimited API requests - paused after 1 week inactivity - 10,000 users w/ 1hour audit trail - 1 GB storage total, 2GB tranfer limit Pro: - $25/project/month - 8 GB database space - 100,000 Users - 100 GB storage total, 200 GB tranfer limit Pay as you go: - $25/project/month (plus usage costs) - $0.125 per GB/project/month - Unlimited users - $0.021 per GB storage total, $0.07 per GB tranfer limit | - PostgreSQL database, works natively with Postgres extensions â€”PostGIS supported - Built-in Authentications (controls exactly what users can access) - Availability: real-time enabled - Spreadsheet like editing as well as sql editor - Provides instant APIs and handles CRUD for users (Python library coming soon) - Connected to Github | - Relatively small database for free and pro tier users - Possibly we have to choose "Pay as you go" plan | Docs: [https://supabase.io/database](https://supabase.io/database) Non-fit with our needs: no strict authentication and real-time needs for open-source data archive (though now using API need application, I assume this application process will be canceled in future) Fit with our project: - instant API (though our API is already finished) - PostGIS supported |
| Hasura | Free tier: - 1 GB data pass-through per month (request data that is sent to upstream services (eg: databases) and response data sent to downstream services (eg: web apps)) - 60 requests/minute Standard $99/mo/project: - 20 GB data pass-through ($2 per additional GB) - Unlimited requests - High Availability Customized enterprise plan | - Build apps and GraphQL APIs 10x faster - Built-in autorization and catching - 5x-50x more performant than hand0rolled APIs - Support PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, AWS Aurora, Google BigQuery, Oracle, mongoDB, etc. - linear scalability - With query size increase, comparable advantage over NodeJS increase - Widely used: McKinsey, netlify, Walmart, etc | - Charge via data passthrough, instead of data storage <br/>-Relatively expensive | Docs: [https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/index.html](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/index.html) - API feature is attractive|
| cockroach | Free tier: with most features and geospatial data types supported Customized plan pricing needs contact|- Spatial data types - Scalability - Data Resistence - Native JSON Support - Active dynamic schema changes - Used by Ebay, DoorDash, Bose, Comcast | - lower throughput and higher latency (compared to yugabyteDB) - Less fit for internet-scale OLTP and no enterprise features - Cheaper than AWS Aurora | Compare different plan: [https://www.cockroachlabs.com/compare/](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/compare/) Compare to Aurora [https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/aurora-price-vs-cockroachdb/](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/aurora-price-vs-cockroachdb/)| 
|Google Spanner| | | - Cloud lock-in - Not postgreSQL-compatible - Less cost effective - Less fit for internet-scale OLTP - relatively small data density | |
|Amazon Aurora | | | - Cloud lock-in - Nonlinear write scalability - relatively long latency - less fit for internet-scale online transaction processing - no built-in enterprise features | |
|Amazon RDS | | | - Cloud lock-in -Less replicable than Aurora| |
|Vitess| | - automated sharding solution for MySQL | - Lack of continuous availability - no single logical SQL database: developers have to be acutely aware of their sharding mechanism while designing their schema as well as while executing queries - mainly for mySQL| |
